# PatchStitching

###### 1. Requirements
Install Pytorch
The code was tested with Python3.6 torch1.4.0 pytorch 1.7.1 cuda10.2

###### 2.Data
The code was trained by PCPNet Dataset
 
###### 3. Train
To train a model run "train_multi_experts3_atten.py".
You also can use "stacked_with_dgcnn_experts3_normal_estimation_nopca2_with_atten256/512/1024" to test for a patch with 256/512/1024 points.

you can obtain the estimation results via BaiduYun link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZDx8TwS9AmJTXxoS1PkePQ  code: 673a
The code is built on the top of PCPNet and DGCNN. Thanks for the precedent contribution.
